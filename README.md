#Spam Email Classification

This project is a Spam Email Classifier that predicts whether an email is Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Multinomial Naive Bayes.
It also includes a simple Flask-based web application with an HTML + CSS frontend to allow users to test the classifier interactively.




Machine Learning: Trained using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

Web Application: Flask backend with a user-friendly HTML & CSS interface.

Interactive Input: Enter your own email text and get predictions instantly.

End-to-End Flow: From text preprocessing to web deployment.


Dataset: Collection of spam/ham labeled emails.

Text Preprocessing:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation & stopwords

Tokenization & vectorization (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)

Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes (best suited for text classification).

Evaluation: Achieved 95.7 accuracy in distinguishing spam vs. ham emails.
